** Mockup
   The dashboard is composed of two pages, accessible via two tabs. The first tab shows information about a single company and the second compares multiple companies. Here is the initial mockup (some charts have been redesigned during the implementing phase):
   - Tab 1 : Company view

   - Tab 2 : Comparative vue

* Git/Github workflow
** Git architecture
   - /Main/ branch contains the validated code
   - /Features/ branches are branches created by the developers to implement backlog items. E.g. branch /t1b1/ implements item t1b1
** Git/GitHub rules
   - Developers work on their /feature/ branches, and once an item implementation is completed, the developer does a pull request for this branch to be merged with the /main/ branch
   - The pull request is sent to the owner of the file to be modified or to the dev team when there is no owner. Once validated the /feature/ branch is merged with the /main/ branch
   - 1 bug correction per commit
   - Commits have to be unambiguous
** Ownerships:
